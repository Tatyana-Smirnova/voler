"whats something that you need (in your life)?"
 - where are places that you search for the things you need?
"have you come across a problem where you didn't have something you needed?"
 - especially at the last minute where you needed it?
 - why didn't you have it / why don't you have it
	can't u find it??
 - when's the last time you bought something you wanted

prove: broke, need things, want things, can't find with current options, people are OK with not owning
ALSO RESEARCH TF OUT OF CURRENT OPTIONS
ASSUMPTION:
people will not inherently abuse items when their credit card is on the line
--> or do they?? small time period to use items means potentially less fuck up
